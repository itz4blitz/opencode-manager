# Repository & Git

Comprehensive git integration for managing repositories and source control.

## Cloning Repositories

Clone any git repository:

1. Click the **Repositories** button in the sidebar
2. Click **Clone Repository**
3. Paste the repository URL
4. Click **Clone**

## Discovering Existing Repositories

Import repositories you already have on disk without recloning them:

1. Click the **Repositories** button in the sidebar
2. Click **Add Repository**
3. Select **Folder Discovery**
4. Enter a parent folder such as `/Users/you/Development`
5. Click **Discover Repositories**

OpenCode Manager scans that folder for nested git repositories and links each one into the workspace. If standalone OpenCode already has chats stored for those same paths, the sessions show up automatically.

### Private Repositories

For private repositories, configure a GitHub Personal Access Token:

1. Go to **Settings > Credentials**
2. Enter your GitHub PAT
3. Ensure the token has `repo` scope

### SSH Repositories

SSH key authentication added for git repositories. Configure SSH keys in Settings > Credentials.

## Git Worktrees

Work on multiple branches simultaneously without switching:

1. Select a repository
2. Click **Create Worktree**
3. Enter branch name
4. A new workspace is created with that branch checked out

Worktrees share the same git history but have independent working directories. This is useful for:

- Comparing implementations across branches
- Working on a feature while keeping main branch accessible
- Testing changes without disrupting your main work

## Source Control Panel

Access comprehensive git operations via the source control button.

### Changes Tab

- View all modified, added, deleted, and untracked files
- Stage/unstage individual files or all changes
- Discard changes to revert modifications
- View diffs inline for any changed file

### Commits Tab

- Browse commit history
- View commit details including message, author, and date
- See file changes in each commit
- Track ahead/behind status with remote

### Branches Tab

- List all local and remote branches
- Create new branches from current HEAD
- Switch branches (checks out the branch)
- Delete local branches

## Diff Viewer

View file changes with a unified diff format:

- **Line Numbers** - Both old and new line numbers displayed
- **Syntax Highlighting** - Code is highlighted based on file type
- **Change Markers** - Additions in green, deletions in red
- **Change Counts** - Summary of lines added/removed

### Accessing Diffs

- Click any changed file in the Source Control panel
- Diffs appear inline or in a modal depending on context
- Use the expand/collapse toggle for large diffs

## Repository Actions

### Pull

Fetch and merge remote changes:

1. Select a repository
2. Click the **Pull** button
3. Changes are fetched and merged

### Fetch

Download remote changes without merging:

1. Select a repository
2. Click the **Fetch** button
3. Remote tracking branches are updated

### Delete Repository

Remove a repository from the workspace:

1. Select a repository
2. Click **Delete**
3. Confirm deletion

## Ahead/Behind Tracking

The UI shows your branch's relationship to its remote:

- **↑ N** - You have N commits not pushed to remote
- **↓ N** - Remote has N commits you haven't pulled
- **↑ N ↓ M** - Both local and remote have diverged
